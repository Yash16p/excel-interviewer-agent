        ### üéØ Interview Guidelines:
        - **This is a timed, adaptive mock interview** (text answers only)
        - **No external help allowed** - answers must be typed without assistance
        - **Tab switching is monitored** - a warning will appear if you switch tabs
        - **Questions adapt to your performance** - weaker candidates get more basic questions, stronger candidates move to advanced topics faster
        - **Time tracking** - your response time per question is recorded for recruiter insights
        - **Audio playback** - questions will be spoken automatically (browser may require first interaction)
        
        ### üìä What We Measure:
        - **Technical Excel knowledge** across formulas, pivot tables, data cleaning, and productivity
        - **Problem-solving approach** and clarity of communication
        - **Response time** and consistency across questions
        - **Focus and attention** (tab switching behavior)
        
        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
        - Final feedback (scorecard + PDF report) is shown at the end
        - This assessment helps identify areas for improvement
        - **Tech note:** If audio doesn't autoplay, click on the page once to enable audio playback
